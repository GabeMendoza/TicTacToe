# Tic Tac Toe

## What? Yet another Tic Tac Toe?

Yeah, I know. But I wanted to five a try at [Go](http://golang.org/) and thought it would be a small enough first project.

## At least tell me how to play.

Simple! If Go is already installed on your machine, you just have to download the project and run:

```
go run play.go
```

## Does not seem really complete, what about some improvements?

I seriously thing that the project needs some unit testing before being improved. But if you want a couple of thing that could be done:

- Unit Testing
- Better error management (just try to play cell 42 and you'll see...)
- Let people play against a computer (bonus for a good AI)
